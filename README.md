Overview
This project implements a simple content-based recommendation system using the IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. It takes a short text description of user preferences as input and returns the top 5 recommended movies based on textual similarity. The system leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compare the userâ€™s input with movie descriptions created from the dataset's genres and plot keywords.

Dataset
Dataset Name: IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
Source: Available on Kaggle or other public repositories.
Description:
This dataset includes metadata for 5000 movies. The CSV file should contain at least the columns movie_title, genres, and plot_keywords. The project combines genres and plot_keywords to form a description for each movie.
Setup:
Download the dataset (typically named movie_metadata.csv) and place it in your project directory.
Setup

Running the Code
Run the recommendation script by passing your query as a command-line argument. For example:
python /Users/jaipdalvi/Desktop/Work/Python\ DSA/9/demo.py "I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist."

The script will output the top 5 recommended movies along with their similarity scores.
